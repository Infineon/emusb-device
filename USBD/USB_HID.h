*
*   Additional information
*     To be able to receive input reports from the host either an endpoint must
*     be allocated (EPOut) or a buffer must be provided (BufferSize, pBuff).
*     If both EPOut == 0 and BufferSize == 0, then USBD_HID_Read() will not
*     work and all requests from the host will be stalled by the USB stack.
*     To receive Set Feature Report control commands the buffer is required.
*
*     pReport points to a report descriptor. A report descriptor is
*     a structure which is used to transmit HID control data to and
*     from a human interface device. A report descriptor defines
*     the format of a report and is composed of report items that define
*     one or more top-level collections. Each collection defines one or
*     more HID reports. Refer to Universal Serial Bus Specification,
*     1.0 Version and the latest version of the HID Usage Tables guide
*     for detailed information about HID input, output and feature reports.
*     The USB Implementers Forum provide an application that helps to
*     build and modify HID report descriptors. The HID Descriptor Tool
*     can be downloaded from:  www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/.
*     The report descriptor used in the supplied example application
*     HID_Echo1.c should match to the requirements of most
*     "vendor specific HID" applications. The report size is defined
*     to 64 bytes. As mentioned before, interrupt endpoints are limited
*     to at most one packet of at most 64 bytes per frame (on full
